# Segmentation with KMeans

**Requirements**: 
- Ensure you have a version earlier than 3.10.12. Consider setting up a conda environment to manage your dependencies.

**Files & Description**:
- `mykmean.py`: Contains the main class with all the necessary methods for KMeans segmentation.
- `km_ping.ipynb`: An example notebook demonstrating the use of KMeans segmentation.
- `help_function.py` & `zaza.ipynb`: Similar to the above two, but they utilize functions instead of a class for the segmentation.
